# Scheduled updates

Knowing how to schedule tasks in linux is a usefull tool for a developer.

**Today you are going to schedule hourly dnf updates and system reboots.**

Also, you will need to deploy WordPress again in your machine, and it must automactly restart after each reboot.

## Notes

### SELinux

We have disabled SELinux; we will be learning about this in a future lab but for now it has been turned off.

### MySQL

We have deployed MySQL server for you, as well as created a database ready for you to use. The username is `wordpress`, the database name is `wordpress`, and the password is the same as your user password. You can see it by running `systemctl status mysqld`:

```
$ systemctl status mysqld
● mysqld.service - MySQL 8.0 database server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/mysqld.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2027-11-21 01:47:02 UTC; 15min ago
  Process: 1105 ExecStartPost=/usr/libexec/mysql-check-upgrade (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
  Process: 852 ExecStartPre=/usr/libexec/mysql-prepare-db-dir mysqld.service (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
  Process: 812 ExecStartPre=/usr/libexec/mysql-check-socket (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
 Main PID: 889 (mysqld)
   Status: "Server is operational"
    Tasks: 37 (limit: 4680)
   Memory: 380.1M
   CGroup: /system.slice/mysqld.service
           └─889 /usr/libexec/mysqld --basedir=/usr
```

**Note:** if you break the mysqld service then you will have made your Lab infinitely harder! It should be sufficient to leave it alone and enter the username/password/db name when prompted.
