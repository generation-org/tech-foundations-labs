# Deploy WordPress

By now, you`re problably familiar with the steps to deploy wordpress. Today, you`re going to make a shell script to do this deploy for you.

You'll need to make a shel script named ```Wordpress.sh``` that sets up a working Wordpress deployment. 

Wordpress must successfully deploy to a new Linux server. You will also need to deploy the MySQL server, and create a database.

Happy coding!

## Notes

### SELinux

We have disabled SELinux; we will be learning about this in a future lab but for now it has been turned off.
